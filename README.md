# Writing Place 

## Writing place is an app about writing prompts, but instead of words, there's a place or a space, from history, the natural world, perhaps literature. Each topic holds up to eight sites, and each site has an image and a bit of a description, enough to spur you to write. 

### This MVP is a project for the Flatiron School's 4th project, JS frontend with Rails API. The API can be found at https://github.com/MiriamPeskowitz/writing_place_backend

### Future features
	1. Add your own topics and site lists
	2. The ability to see all your writing for each topic together, so you can edit and stitch them together, and see something new grow. 
	3. User signup/login
