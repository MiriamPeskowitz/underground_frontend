# Writing Place 

## Writing place is an app about writing prompts, but instead of words, there's a place or a space, from history, the natural world, perhaps literature. Each topic hold up to 8 of these sites, and each site has an image and a bit of a description, hopefully enough to spur you on. you can visit IRL, or use the image and description. 

### Writing Place uses a Rails API that can be found at https://github.com/MiriamPeskowitz/underground_frontend.git

### Future features: 

	1. Add your own topics and site lists
	2. The ability to see all your writing for each topic together, so you can edit and stitch them together, and see something new grow. 
	3. User signup/login
